            fostered a collaborative experience that provided artists and
            creators from Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities of different
            backgrounds, ages, genders, ethnicities, abilities, incomes,
            nationhood, and nationality with a forum to openly discuss and
            better understand the findings of the
            <em>Truth and Reconciliation Commission</em> and the
            <em>94 Calls to Action</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through group discussions and interactions with guest lecturers,
            knowledge keepers, and Residential School and Sixties Scoop
            survivors, the project’s artists and creators gained intimate
            knowledge of the forced removals of Indigenous children from their
            families. They were then encouraged to share their understandings of
            their chosen call through their own lenses and lived experiences.
            Through these visual representations, the project aims to create a
            deeper understanding of the history of colonization that continues
            to impact Indigenous communities across Turtle Island to this day.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em><strong>Echoes from This Land</strong></em> encourages viewers
            to connect with the visual reflections of artists and creators
            interpretating the <em>94 Calls to Action</em>; adding visual
            understanding to the printed words. The project aims to inspire
            people in all communities to gain insight of these calls and enrich
            their understanding and commitment to action. The goal of this
            project is to include all voices in the circle wherein artists and
            creators developed print editions using traditional and new media
            forms of printmaking such as linocuts, woodcuts, stone and plate
            lithography, etching, photo-etching, 3D printing, collagraph, screen
            printing, digital media, and performance or hand/digitally altered
            art creation and production.
          </p>
          <p>
            The works created in the
            <em><strong>Echoes from this Land</strong></em> embody the spirit
            and power of community coming together as a collective voice to
            lift, hold space, listen, and make change happen.

            Special collaborative video for the research of Karen Hill M.D.,
            Elva Jamieson-Traditional Medicine Practitioner, and Bernice Downey
            PhD., and their research “Juddahs Place: An Indigenous Evaluation”.
            Juddah’s Place is a collaborative Primary Care Practice at Six
            Nations of the Grand River Territory that brings together Indigenous
            Practitioners trained in both Traditional Indigenous Healing and
            Western Medicine. The Key Finding of this research is that “We are
            the Medicine for each other” when we embrace the wisdom and ways of
            our culture in all of who we are in the modern world. This video was
            created to share the results of the research that clearly align with
            the Calls to Action in many ways.
