          <hr>
          <p>
            <strong>Echoes from This Land: Visioning and Revisiting the Truth & Reconciliation 94 Recommendations</strong> fostered a collaborative experience that provided artists and creators from Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities of different backgrounds, ages, genders, ethnicities, abilities, incomes, nationhood, and nationality with a forum to openly discuss and better understand the findings of the <i>Truth and Reconciliation Commission</i> and the <i>94 Calls to Action</i>.
            <br>
            Through group discussions and interactions with guest lecturers, knowledge keepers, and Residential School and Sixties Scoop survivors, the project’s artists and creators gained intimate knowledge of the forced removals of Indigenous children from their families. They were then encouraged to share their understandings of their chosen call through their own lenses and lived experiences. Through these visual representations, the project aims to create a deeper understanding of the history of colonization that continues to impact Indigenous communities across Turtle Island to this day.
            <br>
            <strong>Echoes from This Land</strong> encourages viewers to connect with the visual reflections of artists and creators interpretating the <i>94 Calls to Action</i>; adding visual understanding to the printed words. The project aims to inspire people in all communities to gain insight of these calls and enrich their understanding and commitment to action. The goal of this project is to include all voices in the circle wherein artists and creators developed print editions using traditional and new media forms of printmaking such as linocuts, woodcuts, stone and plate lithography, etching, photo-etching, 3D printing, collagraph, screen printing, digital media, and performance or hand/digitally altered art creation and production.
            <br>
            The works created in the <strong>Echoes from this Land</strong> embody the spirit and power of community coming together as a collective voice to lift, hold space, listen, and make change happen.
